  abstract = {The recent focus on large language models (LLMs) has yielded unprecedented discussion of their potential use in various domains, including healthcare. While LLMs show considerable potential in performing human-capable tasks, they also have significant drawbacks, such as generating misinformation, falsifying data, and contributing to plagiarism—issues that are particularly critical in healthcare. As LLMs are explored for applications like generating discharge summaries, interpreting medical records, and providing medical advice, this paper emphasizes the need for a rigorous evaluation framework to assess their natural language processing performance and translational value. A complementary governance layer is proposed to ensure accountability and public confidence, addressing ethical, regulatory, and operational challenges in healthcare deployment.},
